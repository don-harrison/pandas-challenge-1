#Data Analysis with Pandas: Module Challenge

Use a fictional e-commerce dataset to practice data analysis using Python's Pandas library. I worked this dataset to answer business questions such as largest clients by spending. Calculating the spending using shipping costs, unit price, qty, and sales tax. I was able to find the clients who spent the most in our dataset.
